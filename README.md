# PostgreSQL Manager

## Aim
I currently use PgAdmin for most postgresql management needs, but in spite of the major respect I have for the good folks behind that project I do want something a little different, so this is an attempt at coming up with a more agile tool focused on a very small set of features.

## Roadmap
The project is in its infant state and things will probably change or just die out, but so far at least this is the plan:

0. Minimal usability
	0. Have a login screen
	0. Create, update and delete connections to 1+ databases
	0. Handle connections - be able to connect/disconnect
	0. Be able to run arbitrary SQL queries
0. Extended usability
	0. SQL linter
	0. Save/Load snippets
	0. Theming - Be able to load css 


If you would like more features please use the issues feature for this project
